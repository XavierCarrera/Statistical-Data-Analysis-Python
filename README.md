<h2>About this project:</h2>

This Predictive Model is my project for the [Statistics and Data Analysis Foundamentals Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/estadistica-python/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2>Brief description: </h2>

Here you can find a Predective Model which is based on explanatory analysis, which goal is to measure the chances of the Titanic to sink at the time of its departure. For such analysis, we perform a variables selection -- including identification of descriptive data and outliers.
